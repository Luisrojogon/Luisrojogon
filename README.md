Hi there! My name is Luis and I am an Industrial Engineer who holds a Master degree in Industrial Engineering with mention in Optimization from the University of
Santiago of Chile working and developing online algorithms focused in transportation systems, i.e. to optimize without all the information beforehand, the focus
was on a transportation company looking for the incomes per worked time balance (You can see our publication in Science direct "The Balanced Dispatching Problem
in Passenger Transport Systems on Demand). Besides, I have a Master degree in Statistics and Operations Research from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia
working on a Non-Linear Programming model to estimate the transition probabilities involved in the Body Mass Index dynamics, i.e. which is the probability to
change (or remain) its current Body Mass Index within a time period, to forecast the population in each one of them to optimize the budget in public health
(a first publication of this, because we are still working on it, was presented at International Conference on Operations Research and Enterprise Systems entitled
'Mathematical model for estimating nutritional status of the population with poor data quality in developing countries: The case of Chile').

I am also giving lectures of Linear and Integer programming and Non-Linear programming with focus on Machine Learning at University of Santiago, thereby you will
find all the material I have developed to those courses.

You would like to look at my personal google sites https://sites.google.com/usach.cl/luisrojogonzalez/home?authuser=0.

Hope you enjoy it!
